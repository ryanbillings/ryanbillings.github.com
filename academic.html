                            During my Junior Year, I worked with Salim Peshawaria, Sean Chin and Jonghyun Thom to develop a video-chat web application, called <a href="http://strong-journey-4339.herokuapp.com/landing">CMUConnect</a>, for members of the CMU Community.
                            The inspiration behind this project was to allow students to engage in random social interactions through video chat and make new friends.
                            <br/><br/>We entered the annual Carnegie Mellon research competition and won 2nd Place in the Alcoa Competition and 3rd Place in the Johnson & Johnson Competition.

                            One of my class projects in 15-211: Fundamental Algorithms was to write a Chess AI in Java. Using the Alpha-Beta pruning Algorithm,
                            I was able to create a program that could make intelligent moves in a short amount of time. The program was able to beat me
